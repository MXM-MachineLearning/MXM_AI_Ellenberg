This file contains descriptions of all the data files that were created to understand the heisenberg group. 

bfs_heisenberg_data.csv:
Contains data generated by BFS from the origin for the Heisenberg group. 
It contains information about the values for a, c, and b (val1, val2, and val3) as well as the number of steps required to get to this point from the origin and the last matrix applied to get to this state from the origin. 

heisenberg_data_100.csv:
Contains data generated by creating a random string of As, Bs, Cs, and Ds that is 100 matrices long and applying it to the identity matrix to generate an element in the heisenberg group (never applying a matrix and then its inverse)
Where A, B, C, and D are the four matrices that generate the heisenberg group

heisenberg_data.csv: 
Contains data generated by creating a random string of As, Bs, Cs, and Ds that is 30 matrices long and applying it to the identity matrix to generate an element in the heisenberg group (never applying a matrix and then its inverse)
Where A, B, C, and D are the four matrices that generate the heisenberg group

heisenberg_data_test.csv: 
Same as heisenberg_data.csv, just using a different random seed in order to create different data

Q_moves_scores.csv:
Contains val1, val2, and val3 (the three numbers necessary to describe an element in the heisenberg group), the last matrix applied by our random search to generate this element of the heisenberg group, as well as which matrix Q learning learns is the best matrix to apply to this element in order to get back to the origin fastest. 
Additionally, this contains the value that Q learning learned for this state. 
Contains 60% of the different data points for which Q learning is able to find a way to the origin. 

Q_moves_scores_test.csv:
Same as Q_moves_scores.csv, but contains the other 40% of the data points for which Q learning is able to find a way to the origin. 

Q_table_df.csv:
Goes through every entry in the Q_learning table. For each entry, record the values of a, b, and c (the values that sppecify the heisenberg matrix) as well as the value that Q learning learns for each state. 
Higher values at a state means that Q learning thinks it is a better state. 

viz_a_b_sqrt_c.csv:
Dataset created to visualize the relationship between max(a, b, sqrt(c)) and the number of steps Q learning takes to get to the origin
