# MXM-AI-Fall-2023
Code developed for MXM Research Fall 2023 as part of Jordan Ellenberg's project.

We started with working on training a neural network to learn the Euclidean algorithm. Then, we generalized our solution to learn how to apply arbitrary randomly-generated matrices to a coordinate point in order to get closer to the origin. We also trained a Monte Carlo Tree Search to decide which transformations should be applied.
